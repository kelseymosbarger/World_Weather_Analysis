# World_Weather_Analysis
Module 6 - WeatherPy

## Overview
This repository searches among 2000 random locations to find a vacation itinerary and hotel with
in the users preferences on temperature and current weather conditions. PLEASE NOTE:
my libraries in Jupyter were not compromising with eachother so I had to use google colab to be
able to run the map layers. So you will see a slight variation with a few parts in the code.

### Sources:
Jupyter
Colab
Python
CSV files

## Database
the following things were collected from the weather api call:
Latitude and longitude
Maximum temperature
Percent humidity
Percent cloudiness
Wind speed
Current Weather description

## Results
This is an image of all of the possible vacation desitnation that fall within the users input:
