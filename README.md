# World_Weather_Analysis
Module 6 - WeatherPy

## Overview
This repository searches among 2000 random locations to find a vacation itinerary and hotel with
in the users preferences on temperature and current weather conditions. PLEASE NOTE:
my libraries in Jupyter were not compromising with eachother so I had to use google colab to be
able to run the map layers. So you will see a slight variation with a few parts in the code.

### Sources:
Jupyter
Colab
Python
CSV files

## Database
the following things were collected from the weather api call:
Latitude and longitude
Maximum temperature
Percent humidity
Percent cloudiness
Wind speed
Current Weather description

and this is an image of the finalized vacation routes between the destinations, which include pop
up boxes with the hotel and weather info for each location.
